- Favourites and Auto-Load: Mark routes as favourites and choose to load them automatically at app launch.
- Map Decluttering: Temporarily hide routes without unloading them to reduce map clutter.
- Read-Only Design: No accidental edits — your original GPX data stays safe.
- Private by Design: Your GPX files are private unless you choose to share them.
- Cross-Platform Experience: Designed for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS with a consistent, native interface.
- Dark and Light Mode Support: Fully supports system appearance for a comfortable viewing experience.
