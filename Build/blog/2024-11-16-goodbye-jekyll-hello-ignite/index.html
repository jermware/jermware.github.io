      <p>This site is now generated using <a href="https://github.com/twostraws">twostraws’</a> open source static site generator <a href="https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite">Ignite</a>.</p>

      <br /> 
      <p>When I first launced this site back in April 2020 (see <a href="/blog/2020-04-09-welcome-github-jekyll/">Welcome GitHub Pages and Jekyll</a>), it seemed a sensible choice to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as the static site generator for a website hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it has served me well over the last four years.</p>
      <p>However, I always felt somewhat uneasy that <strong>Jekyll</strong> was a black box. I had no real understanding of how it worked and was unable to tweak it if necessary: <em>what it does is what you get</em>. Also, getting it to run locally on my Mac to test changes before deploying them to the live website wasn’t as staighforward as it could have been. In fact, I found it challenging enough that I documented the process (<a href="blog/2020-04-15-installing-jekyll">Installing Jekyll</a>) in case I needed it the future. (<em>Note: it has been some time since I last followed these instructions, and they may no longer work with a clean install of the latest macOS — Sequoia 15.1 at the time of writing.</em>).</p>
      <p>With this in mind, I was always on the lookout for a better alternative. I thought I had found the solution in John Sundell’s <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a> static site generator written in <em>Swift</em>. I spent a little time looking into it but, I’m not sure why, it didn’t gel with me. Almost certainly <em>Publish</em> can do everthing I need. In fact, it’s probably overkill for what I want. So, I held off from migrating my website away from <em>Jekyll</em> …</p>
      <p>… until <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/about">Paul Hudson</a> released <strong>Ignite</strong>.</p>
      <p><em>Side note</em>: If you’re a <em>Swift</em> developer then Paul’s <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com">Hacking with Swift</a> site is the place to go. It’s packed full of information, code samples, and free tutorials to help you learn, and improve, <em>Swift</em> development. If you’re serious about <em>Swift</em> development then a membership to <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus">HWS+</a> is an excellent investment.</p>
      <p><em>Ignite</em> is an open-source static site generator written in <em>Swift</em>, aimed at Swift developers. The codebase is very accessible, and like all of Paul’s work, it is readable and well-documented. I watched Paul’s <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/plus/live-streams/brush-bark">Brush &amp; Bark</a> video, which fully details how to create a website with it. My initial impression was that it was exactly what I was after. I watched the video again and examined the codebase. I was sold. I decided to migrate my website away from <em>Jekyll</em> and adopt <em>Ignite</em>.</p>
      <p>The migration was pretty straightforward. The biggest headache being tweaking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> in my posts to work with <em>Ignite’s</em> markdown parser rather than <em>Jeyll’s</em>. There were a few occasions where I wasn’t sure how to implement something so I either looked at the <a href="https://github.com/twostraws/IgniteSamples">Ignite Samples</a> repository and website, or just delved into the <em>Ignite</em> code base.</p>
      <p><em>Ignite</em> is written in <em>Swift</em>, which is a significant advantage over the black box that is <em>Jekyll</em>. If I’m unsure how to do something or how something works, I can simply look at the code. If I want to implement a feature that isn’t supported, I can develop it myself and submit it as a pull request for possible inclusion in <em>Ignite’s</em> published codebase. Fabulous!</p>
      <p><em>Ignite</em> includes a tool for previewing your website in a local browser. Use the Terminal command: <br /><br /><code>ignite run --preview</code></p>
      <p>That tells Ignite to launch a local web server, then open it in your web browser so you can see what was produced. Under the covers <em>Ignite</em> is using the local web server included with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> installed on all Macs so, unlike <em>Jekyll</em>, there is no complicated installation process needed to get the site working locally.</p>
      <p>With my website migrated to Ignite, it was simply a matter of deploying it to <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>. I couldn’t find any documentation on the Ignite website detailing how to do this. A bit of Googling led me to the article <a href="https://medium.com/@Khaptonstall/building-a-static-site-in-swift-using-ignite-and-github-pages-5fa74f3d9b9d">Building a Static Site in Swift using Ignite and GitHub Pages</a> — exactly what I needed.</p>
      <p>If you’re reading this, everything is working as expected. Happy days!</p>
